Welcome to our CPE final project repository!!

This is a game designed to teach people Arabic and all models and code will be included here.

To use the talk on touch component make sure the camera has audio listener component and the object that makes the sound has an audio source component. Also, that they have the same collision group.

Some files are too large such as some models from sketchfab so they will be linked here.
